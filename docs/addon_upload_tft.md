# Add-on: Upload TFT

## Description

This add-on enables your panel to upload TFT firmware files to the Nextion display,
either automatically after boot or manually via a button in Home Assistant.

The Nextion display has its own controller, memory, and firmware.
The UI elements and firmware are compiled into a TFT file which must be loaded
onto the display for proper functionality.
This add-on handles downloading the TFT file from a remote server (or a local URL)
and transferring it to the display over serial.

> [!NOTE]
> This add-on is **included by default** when using the standard `nspanel_esphome.yaml` package.
> You only need to reference it explicitly if you are using
> [granular package selection](install.md#granular-package-selection)
> or if you previously removed it (e.g., for memory optimization with Bluetooth Proxy).

### How it works

When the device boots and connects to Home Assistant, a version check compares
the current TFT version on the display with the expected version from the firmware.
Depending on your configuration, the add-on will either:

1. **Automatically upload** the matching TFT file after a configurable wait period, or
2. **Wait for a manual trigger** via the "Update TFT display" button in Home Assistant.

The TFT file URL is resolved in this order:

1. If `nextion_update_url` is set in your substitutions → use it as-is, bypassing all other logic
2. Otherwise → build the URL automatically from the **Display model** selector and the current
   firmware version

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Display model** selector (under **Configuration** on your device's page in Home Assistant)
> serves two purposes: it determines which TFT file is downloaded during an upload, and it
> configures the panel's runtime behavior (touch calibration, button layout, display orientation).
> Always keep it set to the option matching your physical hardware.

## Installation

This add-on is already part of the default `nspanel_esphome.yaml` package,
so most users do not need to change anything.

If you are using granular package selection, add the reference to the
`addon_upload_tft` file in your ESPHome settings in the `packages` section,
after the core and standard packages:

```yaml
substitutions:
  # Settings - Editable values
  device_name: "YOUR_NSPANEL_NAME"
  friendly_name: "Your panel's friendly name"
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password
  ota_password: ""  # Optional: set OTA password, or use ${wifi_password} for backward compatibility (see migration guide)
  language: en      # Language code - see docs/localization.md for all supported codes

  # Add-on configuration (if needed)
  ## Upload TFT
  upload_tft_automatically: true

# Basic and optional configurations
packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy
    ref: latest
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - nspanel_esphome.yaml # Basic package (already includes this add-on)
      # Optional advanced and add-on configurations
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_cool.yaml
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_heat.yaml
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_dual.yaml
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_cover.yaml
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_display_light.yaml
```

If you use granular package selection (individual files instead of `nspanel_esphome.yaml`),
add the Upload TFT package explicitly:

```yaml
packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy
    ref: latest
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - esphome/nspanel_esphome_core.yaml
      - esphome/nspanel_esphome_standard.yaml
      - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_upload_tft.yaml  # Upload TFT add-on
```

## Configuration

The following keys are available to be used in your `substitutions`:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Key | Required | Supported values | Default | Description |
| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :- |
| `upload_tft_automatically` | Optional | `true` or `false` | `true` | When enabled, the device will automatically upload the TFT file when a version mismatch is detected after boot. When disabled, you must manually press the "Update TFT display" button in Home Assistant. |
| `upload_tft_baud_rate` | Optional | Positive integer (bps) | `115200` | Baud rate used for the serial transfer to the Nextion display. Lower values are more reliable on noisy setups; higher values are faster. Common values: `9600`, `115200`, `921600`. |
| `upload_tft_wait_ms_after_setup` | Optional | Positive integer (milliseconds) | `300000` (5 min) | Time to wait after display setup completes before starting an automatic TFT upload. This delay allows the system to stabilize after boot. Reduce for faster updates; increase if you experience boot instability. |
| `nextion_update_base_url` | Optional | Valid HTTP/HTTPS base URL | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy/v${version}/hmi` | Base URL used when building the TFT download URL automatically. Override this to host TFT files on a local server while still benefiting from automatic model and version selection. |
| `nextion_update_url` | Optional | Valid HTTP/HTTPS URL | _(empty)_ | Full URL override for the TFT file. When set, this takes absolute priority. The model selector and version logic are completely bypassed and this URL is used as-is. Use only when you need full control over the TFT source, such as for custom TFT files. See [important note below](#nextion_update_url-behaviour). |
| `include_action_upload_tft` | Optional | `true` or `false` | `false` | When set to `true`, registers the `upload_tft` API action, allowing the TFT upload to be triggered from Home Assistant scripts or automations via `esphome.<panel>_upload_tft`. Disabled by default to reduce memory usage at boot. See [important note below](#include_action_upload_tft-behaviour). |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### `nextion_update_url` behaviour

> [!WARNING]
> Setting `nextion_update_url` disables all automatic URL management. The **Display model**
> selector is still used for runtime behavior (touch calibration, button layout), but the
> TFT file downloaded will always be the one at the URL you specified, regardless of which
> model is selected or which version is current. You are responsible for keeping this URL
> pointing to a compatible and up-to-date TFT file.

When `nextion_update_url` is left empty (the default), the add-on builds the download URL
automatically from the selected **Display model** and the current firmware version. This is
the recommended configuration for most users.

### `include_action_upload_tft` behaviour

> [!NOTE]
> This substitution was introduced to address boot-time memory exhaustion on devices running
> memory-intensive configurations (e.g. Bluetooth Proxy). Registering API actions consumes
> heap memory at boot; disabling unused actions recovers that memory.

When set to `false` (the default), the `upload_tft` API action is not registered.
All other functionality of this add-on remains fully operational: automatic TFT upload on
version mismatch, the "Update TFT display" button in Home Assistant, and baud rate negotiation
are all unaffected.

Set this to `true` only if you need to trigger TFT uploads programmatically from Home
Assistant scripts or automations using the `esphome.<panel>_upload_tft` service call.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you were previously calling `esphome.<panel>_upload_tft` from an automation or script,
> add `include_action_upload_tft: true` to your substitutions to restore that behaviour.
> This is a breaking change introduced to improve boot stability on memory-constrained devices.

### Display model options

This add-on extends the **Display model** selector with additional options beyond the hardware
models defined in the base firmware:

| Option | TFT file | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NSPanel EU | `nspanel_landscape.tft` | Standard EU hardware |
| NSPanel US | `nspanel_portrait.tft` | Standard US hardware (portrait) |
| NSPanel US Landscape | `nspanel_landscape.tft` | US hardware mounted in landscape |
| NSPanel Blank | `nspanel_blank.tft` | First-time installation only. See [NSPanel Blank](nspanel_blank.md) |

### Example: Automatic updates with a shorter wait time

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: "YOUR_NSPANEL_NAME"
  friendly_name: "Your panel's friendly name"
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password
  ota_password: ""  # Optional: set OTA password, or use ${wifi_password} for backward compatibility (see migration guide)
  language: en      # Language code - see docs/localization.md for all supported codes

  # Upload TFT configuration
  upload_tft_automatically: true
  upload_tft_wait_ms_after_setup: 120000  # Wait 2 minutes after setup instead of 29s

packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy
    ref: latest
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - nspanel_esphome.yaml
```

### Example: Manual updates only

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: "YOUR_NSPANEL_NAME"
  friendly_name: "Your panel's friendly name"
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password
  ota_password: ""  # Optional: set OTA password, or use ${wifi_password} for backward compatibility (see migration guide)
  language: en      # Language code - see docs/localization.md for all supported codes

  # Disable automatic TFT upload
  upload_tft_automatically: false

packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy
    ref: latest
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - nspanel_esphome.yaml
```

### Example: Using a locally hosted TFT file

Use `nextion_update_url` only when you need to serve a custom or locally hosted TFT file.
For standard setups, the automatic URL resolution based on the **Display model** selector
is recommended instead.

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: "YOUR_NSPANEL_NAME"
  friendly_name: "Your panel's friendly name"
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password
  ota_password: ""  # Optional: set OTA password, or use ${wifi_password} for backward compatibility (see migration guide)
  language: en      # Language code - see docs/localization.md for all supported codes

  # Use a locally hosted TFT file - bypasses automatic model and version selection
  nextion_update_url: "http://homeassistant.local:8123/local/nspanel_landscape.tft"

packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy
    ref: latest
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - nspanel_esphome.yaml
```

### Example: Using a local base URL with automatic model selection

If your network cannot reach GitHub but you want to keep automatic model and version selection,
override `nextion_update_base_url` instead of `nextion_update_url`:

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: "YOUR_NSPANEL_NAME"
  friendly_name: "Your panel's friendly name"
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password
  ota_password: ""  # Optional: set OTA password, or use ${wifi_password} for backward compatibility (see migration guide)
  language: en      # Language code - see docs/localization.md for all supported codes

  # Mirror the TFT files locally and point to your server
  nextion_update_base_url: "http://homeassistant.local:8123/local/nspanel-easy/"

packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy
    ref: latest
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - nspanel_esphome.yaml
```

## Updating the TFT

### Automatic updates

When `upload_tft_automatically` is set to `true` (the default), the device will:

1. Boot and connect to Home Assistant.
2. Receive the current TFT version from the display.
3. Compare it with the expected version from the firmware.
4. If a mismatch is detected, wait for the configured delay
5. If a mismatch is detected, wait for the configured delay
   (`upload_tft_wait_ms_after_setup`) after display setup completes.
6. Automatically start the TFT upload.

> [!NOTE]
> The wait period exists to prevent the TFT upload from starting before the boot process
> has fully completed, as early uploads have been reported to cause issues on some devices.
> During this time the panel may not behave as expected, since the display is running
> an incompatible TFT version.
>
> If you prefer not to wait, you can press the "Update TFT display" button in Home Assistant
> at any time to trigger an immediate upload, bypassing the remaining wait.

### Manual updates

To manually trigger a TFT upload:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & services** > **ESPHome** and select your panel.
2. Under **Configuration**, verify that **Display model** is set to the option matching
   your physical hardware.
3. Press the "Update TFT display" button.
4. The display will start the update process and the device will restart when complete.

## Memory considerations

The TFT upload process requires a significant amount of free memory on the ESP32.
If you are running memory-intensive components such as Bluetooth Proxy alongside this add-on,
the TFT upload may fail due to insufficient memory.

In such cases, you can temporarily remove memory-heavy components, perform the TFT update,
and then re-add them. See the [Memory Optimization](install.md#memory-optimization-strategies)
section in the installation guide for detailed instructions.
