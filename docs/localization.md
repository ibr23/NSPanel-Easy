# Localization

NSPanel Easy supports displaying dates, weekdays, and UI strings in your local language.
Language selection is configured at compile time in your ESPHome YAML, so only the strings for your chosen language
are loaded onto the device — saving memory and allowing the panel to display correct strings even when offline.

## Setting Your Language

Add the `language` substitution to your ESPHome YAML configuration:

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: "your_nspanel_name"
  friendly_name: "Your Panel Name"
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password
  language: pt  # Set your language code here
```

The default language is `en` (English). If no `language` substitution is set, or if an unsupported code is provided,
English will be used as a fallback.

After changing the language, you must recompile and flash your panel for the change to take effect.
