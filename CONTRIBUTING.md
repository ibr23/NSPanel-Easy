## PR Title Format

Every pull request title **must** follow this format:

```text
<prefix>: <Description starting with a capital letter>
```

- The prefix is **always lowercase**.
- A colon and a single space separate the prefix from the description.
- The description starts with a **capital letter**.
- **No trailing period.**

### Allowed Prefixes

| Prefix | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `fix:` | Something was broken and is now corrected |
| `feat:` | A new user-facing feature or capability |
| `improve:` | An enhancement to existing behavior that is neither a bug fix nor a new feature |
| `ci:` | Changes limited to GitHub Actions workflows or CI scripts |
| `docs:` | Documentation-only changes |
| `style:` | Cosmetic or formatting changes with no logic impact |
| `build:` | Build system, dependencies, or packaging |
| `refactor:` | Internal restructuring with no behavior change |
| `test:` | Test additions or corrections only |
| `chore:` | Maintenance tasks that do not fit any other category |

### Examples

```text
fix: Correct baud rate negotiation timeout on EU model
feat: Add per-page brightness control
improve: Reduce boot time by deferring TFT version check
ci: Add PR title validation workflow
docs: Document release prefix conventions
```

### Why This Matters

PR titles become GitHub Release titles verbatim. Users reading the release history
use the prefix to understand at a glance whether an update is a bug fix, a new
feature, or an internal change. Automated pipelines built by community members
also parse these prefixes to classify releases — a non-conforming title will
break those integrations.

A required CI check enforces this format on every PR. The check runs on
`.github/workflows/validate_pr_title.yml`.

## Commit Messages

Individual commit messages within a PR follow the same prefix convention and
format as PR titles. Squash commits inherit the PR title, so keeping them
consistent is the most important thing.

---

## Code Style

- **C++**: 2-space indentation; formatted with `clang-format` (config at `.clang-format`).
  The CI workflow applies and auto-commits fixes.
- **YAML**: Validated with `yamllint` (config at `.rules/yamllint.yml`).
- **Markdown**: Validated with `markdownlint-cli2` (config at `.rules/.markdownlint.jsonc`).
  The CI workflow applies and auto-commits fixes.

All linters run automatically on pull requests. You do not need to run them locally,
but doing so before pushing will save you a round trip.

---

## Branching

Work on a feature branch and open a PR targeting `main`. There is no separate
`dev` branch in the current workflow. Keep branches short-lived and scoped to
a single logical change.
