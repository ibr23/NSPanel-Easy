[![Buy me an ice cream][buymeacoffee-shield]](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/edwardfirmo)

A powerful, code-free customization platform for the Sonoff NSPanel,
built on [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
Configure every aspect of your panel through an intuitive Blueprint UI - no programming required.

> [!TIP]
> **Coming from [Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint](https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint)?**
> Migrating takes less than 10 minutes - no serial flashing, no reconfiguration.
> Follow our [Migration Guide](docs/migration_from_blackymas.md) to get started.

*If this project makes your smart home a little smarter,
consider [buying me an ice cream][buymeacoffee] - it fuels the late-night coding sessions!* 🍦

## Project Highlights

- **No Coding Required:** Customize your NSPanel entirely through a Home Assistant Blueprint UI.
- **Quick Setup:** Get your panel up and running in minutes with a guided graphical interface.
- **Fully Local:** All control stays local - no cloud dependencies, no internet required after setup.
- **Modular Architecture:** Include only the packages you need, keeping firmware lean and efficient.
- **Community-Driven:** Built by the community, for the community. Your feedback and contributions shape every release.

## Prerequisites

- **Home Assistant** - a running instance (see [home-assistant.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/))
- **ESPHome** - installed as a Home Assistant add-on or standalone (see [esphome.io](https://esphome.io/))
- **Sonoff NSPanel** - EU or US model (original, not NSPanel Pro)

> [!NOTE]
> This project uses the **ESP-IDF** framework exclusively.
> Arduino framework support has been deprecated and is no longer maintained.

## Where to Buy

Need a Sonoff NSPanel? Our [Where to Buy](docs/where_to_buy.md) guide lists retailers
across multiple regions — including affiliate links that support this project at no
extra cost to you, and pre-flashed options for those who prefer a ready-to-go setup.

## Architecture

NSPanel Easy comprises three tightly integrated components that work together:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ESPHome Firmware** | Runs on the ESP32 inside the NSPanel, handling communication, sensors, relays, and display control. |
| **Nextion TFT** | The display firmware loaded onto the Nextion screen, defining all UI pages and touch interactions. |
| **HA Blueprint** | A Home Assistant automation blueprint that orchestrates the panel's behavior and entity bindings. |

> [!NOTE]
> Each component is versioned independently and designed to be compatible across releases.
> You do not need to update all three at once - update each at your own pace as new versions become available.

## Documentation & Resources

Full documentation lives in the [docs/](docs/README.md) folder — also published
